/****************************************************************************
 * This test checks that MCell properly catches out of bounds vertex
 * access in POLYGON_LIST (instead of segfaulting).
 *
 * A check was added to MCell on 07/11 in response to an email to
 * mcell-dev by Namrata Mohapatra. He had a Matlab generated input
 * geometry with out of bounds vertex indices causing mcell to segfault.
