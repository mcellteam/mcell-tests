This model is based on
mcell_tests/tests/pymcell4/1200_dyn_vert_tetrahedron_vol_mol_multiple_changes,
removed dynamic geometry changes and added callback registration and checks

Stored data model file used to generate most of it for potential API updates,
it was manually fixed to contain correct floating point values (e.g. changed 0.00999... to 0.01)
