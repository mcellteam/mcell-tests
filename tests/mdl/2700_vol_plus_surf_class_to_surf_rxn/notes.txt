MCell4 places the rxn product on the identical tile when
the tile is empty and there is a single product as MCell3. 

Then there are some differences that MCell4 does not emulate:
MCell3 puts multiple products to the same tile (not tested here),
even when the tile is occupied. 
Also it weirdly keeps the id of the molecule that hit the
wall and sets this id to the product (all other reaction 
products use new id unless the reactant was maintained).
