Based on previous direct transport example, modified products side.
MCell4 did not handle correctly the rxn v' + s, -> s' + r -> since reactant s is reused, it did not change its oprientation.

Got identical output as MCell3 with 
#define MCELL3_SORTED_VIZ_OUTPUT

(and possibly others, uncommented //#define MCELL3_IDENTICAL)
