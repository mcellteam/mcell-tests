Test that uses DEFINE_SURFACE_CLASSES with 
MOLECULE_DENSITY and MOLECULE_NUMBER.

Should be identical to 1820 but MCell3 does not
seem to produce correct result. 
Also it does not really fit BNG Species definition
in MCell4 so the plan is not to support this feature 
unless absolutely needed.
(initial concentration should be done through releases, 
not in Species definition)
