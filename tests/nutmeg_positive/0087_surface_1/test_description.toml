description = "Test all surface reaction types, as well as simple tests of equilibrium and reaction rates. A quantitative test of the basic *-surface reaction types (uni, bi, tri) in various combinations with surface (and some volume) molecules. Note that the bi-directional pathways are in here twice.  This is so that they can be tested via both the non-trimolecular and trimolecular code pathways. The latter is accomplished by adding a bogus trimolecular reaction involving the relevant molecules."
