/* This check tests that counting of surface molecules using
 the ALL_ENCLOSED keyword works properly.

 Previous MCell versions had a bug which caused surface molecule 
 counts to go negative when using the ALL_ENCLOSED keyword. This behavior 
 could be triggered reliably by decreasing the partition size and thus 
 the size of subvolumes.
 The issue was due to a bug in collide_sv_time which would report
 incorrect times for the next collision with subvolume boundaries. This
 in turn would lead MCell to count certain wall crossings multiple
 times screwing up the logic for deciding if a molecule is enclosed
 in a volume or not. The bug was fixed with commit ID 61735063e6.

 This test checks the the count N of molecules A whithin the cube is
 between 0 <= N <= 100.
