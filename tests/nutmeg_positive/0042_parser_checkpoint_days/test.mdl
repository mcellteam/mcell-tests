/****************************************************************************
 * Test 02: Real-time checkpoint options.
 *
 *    A series of tests which checkpoint and exit after 30 seconds.  At the
 *    beginning of the test, a timestamp file is created.  Checking the
 *    timestamp on this file (also stored as an integer in the file, as seconds
 *    since the epoch) against the timestamp on the checkpoint file should give
 *    a reasonable, though not utterly infallible test.
 *
 *    This variant has an exit spec and time specified in days, hours, minutes,
 *    and seconds, with all but the seconds set to 0.
