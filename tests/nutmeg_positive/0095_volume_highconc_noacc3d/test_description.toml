description = "A quantitative test of the basic volume-volume reaction types (uni, bi, tri).  Note that the bi-directional pathways are in here twice.  This is so that they can be tested via both the non-trimolecular and trimolecular code pathways.  The latter is accomplished by adding a bogus trimolecular reaction involving the relevant molecules. This test uses no accurate 3D reactions."
