This test is to validate that handling unimol rxns by 
1) selecting the rxn and 2) computing unimol time from the rxn is correct. 

Alternative approach would be to compute sum of probabilities 
and compute the unimol time from that, but the MCell results match
BNG ODE and SSA simulations and this is such a basic feature that it must 
have been validated already in BNG.    
Also validated againsty COPASI Gibson+Bruck method.



# running MCell in MDL mode
$MCELL_PATH/mcell -mcell4 Scene.main.mdl

# running BNG:
perl '/home/ahusar/bng/RuleBender/BioNetGen/BNG2.pl' 2_unimol_rxns_for_1_reactant.bngl
mkdir -p nf_00001
cp 2_unimol_rxns_for_1_reactant.gdat nf_00001/test.gdat 

# generate a plot (expects file nf_00001/test.gdat):
python $MCELL_PATH/utils/plotter.py -m4 react_data -b .

# a.png then shows how the MCell4 and BNG simulations match
