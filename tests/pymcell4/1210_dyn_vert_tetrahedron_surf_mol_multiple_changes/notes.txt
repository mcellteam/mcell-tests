This model is equivalent to
mcell_tests/examples/pymcell3_4/1305_dyn_geom_surf_tetrahedron_multiple_changes
when line 
    m.mcell_set_with_checks_flag(world, 0)
is commented out (it causes several rng calls).

Stored data model file used to generate most of it for potential API updates,
it was manually fixed to contain correct floating point values (e.g. changed 0.00999... to 0.01)
