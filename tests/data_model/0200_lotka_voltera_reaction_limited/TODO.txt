Reference data were created on 6/4/2020,
then, for an unknown reason (change of a processor?),
the diff with 'data_model_pymcell4' started to fail for 
the last file (iteration 100) and I was unable to
find a good reference.
So, there are at least the first 10 iterations in 
ref_viz_data_4 and reaference react data were removed.

Need to validate it against MCell3.
