Based on 0003_ab_mem_transport_ec2cp_direct

MCell3R instantiates molecules A on the wrong side:

A@EC+Mem@PM -> A@CP+Mem@PM

(however test 0003_ab_mem_transport_ec2cp_direct passes)

Validated visually and with react_output.

Practically identical to data_model_bngl/0012_ab_mem_transport_cp2ec_direct_whole_surf_compartment.
