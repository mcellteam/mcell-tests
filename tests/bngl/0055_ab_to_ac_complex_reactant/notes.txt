Similar as bngl/0052 only checking that reactant maintains bonds.

This test has uncovered issue with rates, there should be two ways how to apply this unimol rxn,
but MCell4 originally found just one.  

This is the original rxn report:

rxn class for reactants: 
    A(x!2,bc!1).A(x,bc!3).B(a!1,a!3).X(a!2) (3)
  pathways were not initialized
0: products based on rule A(bc!1).B(a!1) -> A(bc!1).C(a!1) 100000 (id: 0)
    A(x!2,bc!1).A(x,bc!3).C(a!1,a!3).X(a!2) (4) 
cum_probs: 0.1, max_fixed_p: 0.1


Fixed so that the rate is correct now:

rxn class for reactants: 
    A(x,bc!1).A(x,bc!2).B(a!1,a!2) (3)
  pathways were not initialized
0: products based on rule A(bc!1).B(a!1) -> A(bc!1).C(a!1) 100000 (id: 0)
    A(x,bc!1).A(x,bc!2).C(a!1,a!2) (4) 
1: products based on rule A(bc!1).B(a!1) -> A(bc!1).C(a!1) 100000 (id: 0)
    A(x,bc!1).A(x,bc!2).C(a!1,a!2) (4) 
cum_probs: 0.1, 0.2, max_fixed_p: 0.2
