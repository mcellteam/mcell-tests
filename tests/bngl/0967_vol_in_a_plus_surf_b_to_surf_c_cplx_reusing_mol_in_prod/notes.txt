Rxn used in this is not supported yet:

  va(a!1).vx(x!1)@CP + sb(b!1).sy(y!1)@PM -> sc(c!1).sy(y!1)@PM 1e8

the issues is that sy(y!1) is in the reactant and product side but sb changes to sc.
So far this case was uncommon, so keeping this for later.

A release assert is printed:
rxn_rule.cpp:563: BNG::vertex_descriptor_t BNG::get_bond_target(BNG::Graph&, BNG::vertex_descriptor_t, bool): Assertion `!comp_found && "Used rule is not supported yet, probably due to finding only a partial match from reactant to product such as sb(b!1).sy(y!1) -> sc(c!1).sy(y!1)"' failed.
