Same as 1510 only rxn rate is lower

The issue is:

MCell3R compute_pb_factor: 
reactants have orientation 'up' even it is not specified explicitely anywhere:

      if ((rx->geometries[0] + rx->geometries[1]) *
                  (rx->geometries[0] - rx->geometries[1]) ==
              0 &&
          rx->geometries[0] * rx->geometries[1] != 0) {
        pb_factor *= 2.0;
      }
      
In MCell4, the default orientation is 'any', so the rates are not multiplied.

      if ( ((orient0 + orient1) * (orient0 - orient1) == 0) && (orient0 * orient1 != 0) ) {
        pb_factor *= 2.0;
      }         
      
      
In MCell3R it seems that in Rec(a) + Lig(l,l) -> ..

Rec@PM has some default orientation 1 (UP) and Lig@EC comes from the top so its orientation is UP as well.
So the MCell3R implemeentation seems correct although there's maybe too much of implicit assumptions.
