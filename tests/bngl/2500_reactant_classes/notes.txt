Test for reactant classes,
used to assert with debug mode in iteration ~34000

Skipped for testing variants
bngl_data_model_pymcell4_w_bngl
and
bngl_data_model_pymcell4
testing variants give different result because some minor changes in precision, 
they can be seen already around iteration 10000. 


It also depends on the defautl setting of Config.molecules_order_random_shuffle_periodicity.
