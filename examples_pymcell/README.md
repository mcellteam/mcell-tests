This directory contains pyMCell examples. 
All the source data are present here, those usually are:
- .py file that uses pymcell
- .json file exported from blender
- generated .mdl files of a reference model  


Reference output and scripts for testing will be added in the future. 

To run the pymcell tests, a system variable MCELL_DIR must be set e.g. like this:

export MCELL_DIR=\`pwd\`/../../../../mcell/build
